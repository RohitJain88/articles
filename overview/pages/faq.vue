            <h3>Who are you?</h3>

            <p>
             We’re a non-profit group of researchers, programmers security experts and public health professionals. Starting from a forum post on February 19, our team, led by researchers from Stanford University and the University of Waterloo, has grown to a group of around 10-15 core contributors, as well as many more part-time volunteers and advisors. Although we are aiming to develop an app for initial use in the USA, the team is based around the world.
